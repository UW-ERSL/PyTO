"""One-object thermo-mechanical solver: thermal solve, thermal force, structural solve.

The optimization drivers take a single `fe_solver` and call `fe_solver.solve(x, material_model)`. For a
coupled problem that call has to run the whole chain

    T(x) = thermal solve         K_T(x) T = q
    F_th(x, T)                   thermoelastic nodal force (design dependent)
    u(x) = structural solve      K(x) u = F_mech + F_th

Everything is torch, so autograd differentiates through both adjoints and the drivers need no coupled
sensitivity code. The compliance is the energy form u^T K u (= F_total . u), which is what the shared
qoi code already computes from `sol`.
