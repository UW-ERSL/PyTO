"""Which methods can solve a formulation, where their gradient comes from, and a gradient check (plan S4).

The GUI uses method_support() to enable only the methods that can solve the problem the user built (with the reason
shown for the others), gradient_source() to state how each method gets its gradient, check_gradient() to compare the
autograd gradient with finite differences before a long run, and cost_estimate() to show how many linear solves an
iteration needs.
