"""User-defined objective/constraint (TO_QOI.GFUNCTION).

The user supplies a Python function written with torch operations:

    def my_qoi(sol, x, fe_solver) -> torch scalar
        sol       : (n_dof,) FE solution (displacement, temperature, ...) -- part of the autograd graph
        x         : (n_elems,) physical (filtered) density used in the solve
        fe_solver : the FE solver, for mesh, bc, material, element stiffness, ...

and sets it in the (type, param[, limit]) slot the other QOIs use:

    to_params.Objective   = (TO_QOI.GFUNCTION, my_qoi)
    to_params.Constraints = [(TO_QOI.GFUNCTION, my_qoi, limit)]   # my_qoi <= limit  (limit > 0)
                            [(TO_QOI.GFUNCTION, my_g, None)]      # my_g   <= 0      (already normalized)

The gradient is computed by autograd through the FE solve (adjoint), so no sensitivity has to be written. The
function must use torch operations only (NumPy breaks the gradient path) and must depend only on its
arguments. Only the MMA driver supports it; OC, Pareto and LevelSet use hand-derived sensitivities.
