"""Smoke tests for the three optimizer drivers: does a couple of iterations
run at all, on both physics, without exceptions?

The xfail cases here are not aspirational -- each one was verified to fail
with exactly the stated exception before being marked, and documents a real,
currently-broken path found during the file-restructuring plan's Phase 0.
They are the "did I fix it" signal for later phases (see
~/.claude/plans/cheerful-dazzling-seahorse.md, Phase 4/5): once a phase's
fix lands, its xfail should start showing as an unexpected pass (XPASS) and
be promoted to a normal passing test.
