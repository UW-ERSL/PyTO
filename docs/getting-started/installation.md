# Installation

This page sets up a Python environment for PyTO and checks that it works. It is for everyone, whether you plan to use the GUI or the library.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.10.** Other versions may work but are not tested.
- **conda** (Anaconda, Miniconda or Miniforge). The GUI launcher looks for a conda environment named **`PyToLib`**.
- **Operating system:** Linux, Windows or macOS. On macOS the PARDISO solver is not available, and PyTO uses SciPy's solver instead.
- **Memory:** a few GB for problems up to about 100 000 degrees of freedom.

## Steps

1. Get the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UW-ERSL/PyTO
   cd PyTO
   ```
   To use a branch other than `main` (for example `AutoPyTO`), run `git checkout AutoPyTO` after cloning.

2. Create and activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n PyToLib python=3.10
   conda activate PyToLib
   ```

3. Optional but recommended: install the **CPU build of PyTorch** first. It is much smaller than the default GPU build, and PyTO doesn't need a GPU.
   ```bash
   pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
   ```

4. Install PyTO's dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   For running the test suite too, use `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` instead. It includes everything above plus pytest.

5. Check the installation:
   ```bash
   python run_gui.py --check
   python docs/examples/quickstart.py
   ```
   - The first command should print `OK: ... has all GUI modules.`
   - The second runs a small optimization in about 10 seconds and writes `quickstart_topology.png`.

## Optional packages
Listed at the end of `requirements.txt`; install them only if you need them.

| Package | For |
|---|---|
| `cupy-cuda12x` (or `cupy-cuda11x`) | GPU deflation solver |
| `petsc4py` | PETSc linear solvers (Linux/macOS) |
| `pypiwin32` | SolidWorks interface (Windows) |

## Linear solvers
Every FE solver takes a `solver=` argument from `pyto.solve.solvers.Solvers`.

| Solver | When |
|---|---|
| `PARDISO` | Default; fastest direct solver (Intel MKL). Not on macOS. |
| `SPSOLVE` | SciPy direct solver; works everywhere. Use it on macOS or if PARDISO is missing. |
| `PETSC` | PETSc solvers, if `petsc4py` is installed. |
| `DPCG`, `PCG`, `PYAMG`, `SPLU` | Iterative and other solvers of the NumPy backend. During **optimization** they are **not** used: PyTO warns and falls back to `SPSOLVE`. |

## Using PyTO without installing it as a package
PyTO is used straight from the repository: the code lives in `src/pyto`.
- `run_gui.py` and the examples in `docs/examples/` add `src/` to the import path themselves.
- For your own scripts, either do the same (`sys.path.insert(0, "path/to/PyTO/src")`) or set `PYTHONPATH`:
  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/PyTO/src        # Windows PowerShell: $env:PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\PyTO\src"
  ```

## Running without a screen (servers, scripts)
PyVista opens windows by default. For scripts, benchmark runs and tests, set:
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=Agg PYVISTA_OFF_SCREEN=true QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen
```
or in Python, before plotting: `import pyvista; pyvista.OFF_SCREEN = True`.
