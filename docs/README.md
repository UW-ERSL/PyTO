# PyTO documentation

PyTO is a Python library for **3D topology optimization** on voxel (hexahedral) meshes, with a desktop GUI on top. These pages explain how to use it from code, how to use the GUI, how to work with results, and how to extend it with new physics, filters, objectives and optimization methods.

New here? Start with **[Installation](getting-started/installation.md)**, then the **[code quick start](getting-started/quickstart-code.md)**.

## Getting started
| Page | What you learn |
|---|---|
| [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) | Set up the conda environment and check it |
| [Quick start: code](getting-started/quickstart-code.md) | Your first optimization in about 30 lines of Python |
| [Quick start: GUI](getting-started/quickstart-gui.md) | Your first optimization by clicking |
| [Quick start: notebook](getting-started/quickstart-notebook.md) | Run any benchmark problem from `main.ipynb` |

## Part 1: Using PyTO from Python
| Page | What you learn |
|---|---|
| [Concepts](code/concepts.md) | The objects (mesh, boundary conditions, FE solver, density, responses, formulation, driver) and how they connect |
| [A problem from scratch](code/problem-from-scratch.md) | Build mesh, material, supports, loads and solver yourself, then optimize |
| [Selecting nodes and faces](code/selecting-nodes-and-faces.md) | Find the nodes and elements for supports, loads and named selections |
| [Formulations with specs](code/formulation-with-spec.md) | Describe objective, constraints and method as data (`OptimizationSpec`) |
| [Expressions](code/expressions.md) | Write objectives and constraints as formulas; full list of quantities |
| [User-defined functions](code/user-defined-functions.md) | Any objective or constraint as a Python (torch) function |
| [Running the optimizers](code/running-optimizers.md) | MMA, OC, Pareto, LevelSet: arguments, results, callbacks |
| [Gradients](code/gradients.md) | Automatic differentiation vs manual gradients, gradient checks, cost |
| [Thermal and thermo-structural problems](code/thermal-and-thermostructural.md) | Heat conduction and coupled problems from code |

| [Analysis](gui/analysis.md) | Mesh, analyse, and look at deformation, stress and temperature |
| [Optimization setup](gui/optimization-setup.md) | Objective, constraints, method, gradient; validate and run |
| [Manufacturing options](gui/manufacturing-options.md) | Symmetry, cyclic symmetry, extrusion, keep-solid |
