# Export

This page shows how to get a result out of PyTO: as a VTU file for ParaView, as a smooth STL for CAD and printing, or as a tetrahedral mesh for re-analysis. It is for anyone passing designs to other tools.

The steps are taken from [`docs/examples/postprocess.py`](../examples/postprocess.py), which runs all of them in about 15 seconds.

## VTU (ParaView, VisIt)
```python
mesh.export_vtu_mesh(elem_field=mesh.elemPseudoDensity, density_field="density", file_name="design.vtu")
```
- Writes the hex mesh with the element field (and its node average) under the name `density_field`.
- Any per-element array can be exported the same way, e.g. `fe.vonMisesStress` with `density_field="von_mises"`.
- `mask_low_pseudodensity=True` keeps only elements with density > 0.5.
- In ParaView, use **Threshold** on `density` (e.g. ≥ 0.5) or **Contour** at 0.5 to see the part.

## Smooth STL
Voxel results have staircase surfaces. PyTO's STL recovery produces a smooth part that keeps the original STL's outer surfaces:
1. A small 3D convolutional network is trained, for a few seconds, on the voxel density to smooth it. The **void** isosurface is then extracted with marching cubes.
2. That void surface is **subtracted** from the original design-domain STL (a boolean operation with `trimesh` and `manifold3d`). Faces that were never optimized, like mounting faces, keep their exact CAD shape.

```python
import pyvista
from pyto.io.topopt_stl_recovery import extract_isosurface_cnn, subtract_voids_from_stl

voids = extract_isosurface_cnn(pyvista.read("design.vtu"), isovalue=0.5)
part = subtract_voids_from_stl(mesh.stlMesh.triangulate().compute_normals(), voids)   # mesh made from an STL
part.save("design.stl")
```
- `mesh.stlMesh` is the STL the mesh was made from. For a box mesh (`grid_mesh`) there is none: build a box STL first, e.g. `pyvista.Box(bounds=...).triangulate()`.
- If the boolean subtraction fails (e.g. a non-watertight STL), the original STL is returned and a message is printed. Repair the input STL, or export the voxels instead.
- In the GUI: **TopOpt Postprocess → Apply Postprocess** does this and writes `<name>_optimized.stl` next to your STL.

## Tetrahedral mesh
For re-analysis in another FE program, or to check the smooth part:
```python
from pyto.core.tet_mesher import TetMesher

tet = TetMesher()
tet.createTetMeshFromSTLFile("design.stl", nElemsDesired=20000)      # uses tetgen
# tet.node_xyz (nodes, 3), tet.elems (elements, 4)
```
- The STL must be watertight; the GUI checks this first and reports non-manifold edges.
- In the GUI: **TopOpt Postprocess → Generate TetMesh**.
- PyTO's own FE analysis is hex-only. Tetrahedral FE analysis inside PyTO is not supported.

## Images
All `plot_*` methods take `save_path=`; see [Fields and plots](fields-and-plots.md). In the GUI, **Display Options → Save Image** saves the 3D view.

## Projects
The GUI's **Projects** window saves the whole setup: STL path, units, material, loads and supports, and the formulation. See [Projects](../gui/projects.md). From code, save the formulation with `spec.to_json()` ([Formulations with specs](../code/formulation-with-spec.md#save-and-load)).
